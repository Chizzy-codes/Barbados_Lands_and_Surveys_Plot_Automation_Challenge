# Barbados_Lands_and_Surveys_Plot_Automation_Challenge
My solution to the Barbados Lands and Surveys Plot Automation Challenge Hackathon on Zindi.

In Barbados, all survey plans must be submitted in analog form to the Chief Surveyor's Office in the Lands and Surveys Department. Currently, these analog documents are manually captured to be entered into Barbados’ Survey Plan Register, a process which is costly in terms of time and manpower, and can result in errors in data capture.

Your challenge: build a solution that can automatically detect and extract land plot shapes from scanned survey plans, and convert them into standard digital formats like shapefiles. On top of that, you'll also need to pull out important metadata like the lot number, parcel area, and surveyor name, using OCR or other machine learning techniques. The extracted digital data will then be in a format that can easily be entered into a digital registry.

This is a pilot challenge, focused on just one district in Barbados, but the winning models will be put into practice for the whole country. Your models will help modernise how land records are handled, saving time and money, reducing errors, and unlocking new social and economic benefits for all on the island.
